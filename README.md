# Using Artificial Intelligence to Optimise Aerofoil Designs

Vision:
The application can be used by hobbyists in aircraft design, who may wasnt to see how Artificial Intelligence could be used to design working aerofoils.
The generative design application is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence to generate designs of aerofoils, that will iteratively generate and optimise designs whilst adhering to design constraints that can be set in the program.
The program has a GUI element that can show the generated design to the user as well as being the interface that users use to input parameters.
